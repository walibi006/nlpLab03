The project consists of 3 main parts:
  - Getting the imdb dataset and extracting features from the texts
  - Implementing a logistic regression and training it on the dataset
  - Analyzing the accuracy of our regression

Our implementiation consists of a single file, `NLP-Lab02.ipynb`, which contains all the code for the project.
It uses the following libraries:
  - `datasets` for the dataset
  - `PyTorch` for the Logistic regression
